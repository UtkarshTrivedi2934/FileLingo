Parui et al. quick growth of AI software and hardware technologies have been incorporated into many technological domains [1], including the Internet of Things, computer vision, autonomous driving, natural language processing, and robotics. When researchers used AI in the biomedical area to enhance the results of analysis and therapy, they uncovered an intriguing side to the technology [2]. As a result, the effectiveness of the healthcare sector as a whole has grown. The new healthcare paradigm must shift from acute, reactive, or even preventative to proactive. Artificial intelligence is being used by an increasing number of medical sensors to diagnose patients more accurately and to monitor and treat them more successfully [3]. Artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor-based devices are widely used in medicine, particularly in the fields of medical image analysis and monitoring systems. Till now detecting neuro-degenerative disease using AI is a very common and emerging field [4,5]. Because we are not certain of the ground truth or, to put it another way, we lack standardization or have very limited knowledge about the human brain, it continues to be a mystery to us since it behaves differently in various people. As a result of its unpredictability, the human brain is a trendy topic among academics. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the least understood neurological disorders that has been recently recognized to have major sociological consequences on an affected individual’s life. A person having ASD faces several sociological and behavioral challenges that affect his/ her societal interactions and communication abilities. Individuals with ASD are known to exhibit restricted interests and have repetitive behaviors. Even though ASD has been recognized since the early 1960s, the actual etiology remains uncertain. ASD affects one out of every 68 children in the United States [6]. Early detection is considered the key to developing an appropriate, comprehensive, and advanced treatment plan. A symptom-based diagnosis is common. However, this requires prolonged behavioral examinations under the supervision of a highly skilled multidisciplinary team. Further, owing to a lack of definitive etiological causation, symptom-based diagnosis frequently leads to ineffective therapy. The shortcomings of current clinical approaches, as well as a lack of understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying ASD, necessitate the development of new biomarkers and computational techniques to help clinicians and neuroscientists better understand how the ASD brain differs from a normal brain. Of late, advances in neuroimaging technologies have made it possible to quantify the functional and structural changes associated with ASD of the brain. According to substantial brain imaging studies, it is now known that ASD has a close link to neural connections in the brain. Individuals suffering from ASD show both under-connectivity and hyper-connectivity between certain regions of the brain. This explains why their lack of empathy and social function may be compensated with extraordinary performance in other activities. Neuroimaging opens the possibility to analyze these connectivity features in the brain map, which might become the biomarker for differentiation between ASD subjects and typically developing (TD) controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been proven to indicate functional connectivity in ASD brains compared to control brains. Functional connectivity analysis has gained popularity in recent years because it is a simple and cost-effective technique to explore the intrinsic connections between neurons in the brain. Yet the existing approaches lack a wider framework of brain abnormalities detection with fMRI data. It is still unknown how certain brain areas are linked to ASD brain abnormalities. Broadly, functional connectivity measurement is based on the correlation of activation time series in pairs of brain areas. In fact, traditional computational and statistical tools are unable to detect tiny biomarker patterns and categorization. Machine learning algorithms have been explored to identify biomarkers from fMRI datasets. Later on, deep learning approaches like convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied to solve the problem as a classification problem. However, in the machine learning approach, for a high-dimensional feature space such as the fMRI data, a large amount of training data is often necessary to ensure that enough samples with each combination of values are available. The same is true for deep learning techniques. Although various research on this topic is currently receiving attention, the complexity of this process and estimating the ideal connection remains an open research problem. Despite its numerous advantages, fMRI data can be difficult to deal with due to its complexity, which makes it difficult to remove noise from the data and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Another problem of this research is the lack of availability of a proper dataset for the experiment. Only using data from several sites to train a model may make it difficult for the network to capture complicated patterns in functional connectivity, lowering classification accuracy. The multi-site dataset has an issue with data heterogeneity, whereas the single intra-site dataset is ineffective for training classification algorithms. Research gap and Motivation Brain region identification is a non-trivial task as it varies from one subject to another. Further, fMRI data being Spatiotemporal data suffers from the dimensionality problem. As a consequence, it is another non-trivial task to find connectivities among regions. Even if the need for designing an ideal brain network utilizing the FCN technique is increasing every day, certain factors make it inconsequential and tough to understand. Therefore, the difficulties have persisted thus far for the following reasons: 1. Subject variability and the fact that every person’s brain functions differently. Whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) is consistent among participants, but it also contains a subject-specific component. And the method researchers have used to date considered the above-mentioned theory which is partially correct. Because the high-order algorithms have shown that the complex pattern of the brain for all subjects is actually not identical especially when the patients and healthy control both are involved. 2. There is still a lot of opportunity for improvement, and the ‘‘curse of dimensionality’’ is a well-known issue. If we have more features than data, we risk drastically overfitting our model, which would result in poor out-of-sample performance. To minimize over-fitting and hence improve model prediction accuracy and generalization ability, feature reduction is a crucial step before training a machine learning model. And fMRI data is huge in size and to eliminate the previous issues we have maintained versatility in choosing the data set. So it is very obvious that the data is stored in high dimensions and we need to come up with a solution by which we can improve the accuracy by reduction of features keeping the subject variability issue in mind. Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 3 S. Parui et al. 3. For better estimation of the data researchers came up with many solutions like Pearson Correlation coefficient, Sparse Correlation Analysis, Granger Causality, Bayesian Network, Dynamic Causality Modeling, Patels Condition Dependence, etc. Among them, the correlation-based method worked well for ASD datasets previously and proved to be more sensitive than the above-mentioned higher-order complex model. Though the Pearson Correlation method has been depicted as a successful way of making FCN for such disorder detection in some papers. [7] has addressed the problem of considering identical topology for each and every subject which is not at all convenient where the patients and healthy controls both were involved. The approach described above, therefore, operates under two very distinct assumptions depending on the topological nature of the brain. Therefore, a new approach must be developed that adheres to both assumptions while also upholding the notion that brains have comparable but not identical structures. 4. Another research gap we found is that not much work has been done to understand the proper brain atlas for the selection of nodes and calculation of correlation matrix for any particular disease. As we have discussed earlier subject variability is a big issue to date so it is quite obvious that one brain atlas cannot be taken as a standard to find out the region of interest. People frequently believe that the disparities in our individual personalities and cognitive talents mirror the variances in the ways in which our brains are connected or the nodes are connected. Although individual differences in brain connectivity have long been acknowledged in the neuroscience community, they have not yet been reflected in the resting state study methods during fMRI data collection. Objectives of the work The primary objective is the prediction of ASD from the fMRI data of a subject. In brief, the main objectives of this work are as follows: 1. To extract the signal from specified regions of interest and thus understand the time series signal hidden in the voxel-wise analysis of fMRI data. For this step, we used different brain atlases to find out the most optimized ROIs for this experiment. 2. To compute the atlas-based low-estimated rank tensor of the functional connectivity matrices to explore the inherent similarities in the topology across subjects as a bio-marker to diagnose ASD and to avoid the ‘‘curse of dimensionality’’. 3. To extract the features and classify the healthy controls and patients by a deep learning model and find the best model for each ATLAS to design the final model. Also, we need to test the deep learning model and train it on both the FCNs and their low-rank components and compare the results. Overview of the work In this study, we offer a unique method for estimating FCNs across patients which considers that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies. More specifically, we put this theory into action in three steps. First, we estimate FCNs using conventional techniques. The estimated FCNs are then stacked (in reality, their associated adjacency matrices) to form a tensor, and the FCNs are redefined using the low-estimated rank tensor (LERT) approach. LERT is a unique algorithm that can optimize the initialized FCN in such a way that the tensor can be approximated with a lesser rank. The initially estimated FCNs from the Pearson Correlation technique are staked into a three-order tensor and then recalculated the FCNs through LERT. We aim to employ a low-estimated rank tensor approach on the functional connectivity matrices, exploring the inherent similarities in the topology across subjects as a bio-marker to diagnose ASD. We have tested this algorithm with 6 brain Atlases (AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling), HO (Harvard--Oxford), EZ (Eickhoff--Zilles), TT (Talaraich and Tournoux), DOS (Dosenbach 160), CC200 (Craddock 200)) which consist of different numbers of ROI, and combined the results to get better accuracy in results in minimum time and complexity. To do so we have used the majority voting algorithm on the brain atlases mentioned earlier after applying a low estimated rank tensor approach and then combined the results coming out from each atlas and predict the results on the test data set. In this study, we offer a unique method for estimating FCNs across patients which considers that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies (Fig. 1). More specifically, we put this theory into action in five steps. 1. First the region of interest has been generated for different brain atlas. The brain atlases used in this project are — AAL with 116 ROIs, HO with 111 ROIs, EZ with 116 ROIs, TT with 97 ROIs, DOS with 161 ROIs, and CC200 with 200 ROIs. 2. For each brain atlas, the correlation between each pair of ROIs was computed from the average time series. First, we estimate the covariance between each pair of ROIs, populate them in a covariance matrix, and then calculate the correlation matrix from the covariance matrix. 3. We develop a model to jointly estimate FCNs using Low Estimated Rank Tensor or LERT method. By using the method we are approximating high-dimensional data by its low-rank form, with the premise that the useful information can be represented by a few components based on natural data clustering. 4. The newly modified FC matrix is then transformed into a tensor and a 2-dimensional CNN has been trained with the tensor. Steps 2–4 have been repeated for each brain atlas mentioned in step 1. 5. Then a majority voting algorithm has been applied to each prediction coming from classifiers for different brain atlases. The output (whether the subject is a patient or a healthy control) has been reported. Contribution of the work Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 4 S. Parui et al. 1. As previously stated, there is currently no known treatment for ASD, and diagnosis is particularly challenging because question-and-answer-based diagnosis is not thought to be reliable. Early and accurate detection of ASD can result in early counseling and treatment, which can aid in the patient’s recovery. From the patient’s fMRI data, a well-designed cognitive framework can provide a diagnosis of the ailment. In this article, we have put up a paradigm based on strategic planning that can more accurately diagnose the condition using the rs-fMRI signal. Through this method, we may be able to diagnose the illness earlier and begin treatment as soon as feasible. 2. Because rs-fMRI data contains a spatiotemporal signal, many ways to reduce its dimensionality have been tested. As previously stated, the dimension of the fMRI data set is a major issue that can be handled with this single strategy. We reduced the rank of the matrix in this research by estimating the value, and thus the dimension, which allowed us to eliminate the issue of memory consumption as well as time demand. 3. The variety of subjects has also been discussed as a significant concern in this research. For each participant, the topography of the brain is somewhat similar but obviously not identical. Therefore, it is not possible to examine any atlas and obtain reliable results. To eliminate any prejudice, we used a voting mechanism in this article along with topological considerations. Furthermore, because each summary measure captures distinct components of the temporal dimension of the rs-fMRI data, we sought to integrate the various inputs for classification. 4. In this paper, we looked at the concepts of comparable topology and also identical topology. To eliminate subject prejudice, two distinct assumptions were taken into account. A new technique has been devised that supports the claim that two brains are not the same. And thus we can also successfully distinguish the healthy brain and autistic brain. 5. We employed the greatest number of brain ATLAS to eliminate bias and to account for subject variability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study attempted to employ such measures extensively utilizing deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, because each summary measure captures distinct components of the temporal dimension of the rs-fMRI data, we sought to integrate the various inputs for categorization. 6. We have tested this algorithm with 6 numbers of brain ATLAS which consist of different numbers of ROI and combined the results to get better accuracy in results in minimum time and complexity. To do so we have used the majority voting algorithm on various brain atlas after applying low-rank tensor approximation and then combined the results coming out from each atlas and predict the results on the test dataset. Organization of the paper The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work has been discussed. Section 3 depicts the material and methods used for the experiment which explains the dataset and the steps followed. It also explains the architecture of each model used. Section 4 presents the results observed. Section 5 concludes the work. 2. Related work This section surveys the different techniques related to ASD detection using brain fMRI data. The works are categorized as computational methods, traditional methods, non-graphical methods, graph connectivity network, and multi-view graphical methods and are presented in the following. Computational techniques: ASD has been found to impact global brain networks by disrupting functional connectivity between numerous brain areas. As a result, recent research has focused on multivariate analysis using machine learning (ML) techniques to facilitate patient-specific disease quantifiers. Using various imaging modalities, these classifier-based approaches have demonstrated relatively good prediction accuracies [8]. ML has also been able to assist in the prediction of ASD by adding relationships between brain areas via large-scale structural and/or functional brain connections. The use of neural networks and deep learning methods including autoencoders (AEs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting ASD has recently become highly popular. Using 10-fold cross-validation, Lidaka et al. [9] employed the probabilistic neural network and intrinsic connection analysis to achieve an accuracy of classification of 86.9% between 312 patients with ASD and 328 TD. Brown et al. [10] used an element-wise layer for CNNs to achieve a classification accuracy of 68.7% on 1013 subjects. Using the deep learning method, Heinsfeld et al. [11] studied FC patterns and reached a classification accuracy of 70%. However, Heinsfeld et al. did not study the changes in categorization between locations. Classification accuracy suffers dramatically when bigger population samples from different places are used. Researchers have used a variety of methods for analyzing brain functional networks since the beginning. The approaches for detecting ASD have yielded good results. Different ideas have been used for different issues with different intentions. We will go over each one individually to get a sense of their work and determine which areas still need to be addressed. Traditional method: Mostly cross-correlation analysis has been used to retrieve the information from data in the case of functional connectivity analysis. Cao and Worsley have established this technique for the first time for functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data analysis [12]. The seed-based correlation method [13] is the simplest method and very usual among all correlation techniques but it has some limitations. Later to overcome the limitations Pearson Correlation method [14] has been introduced to make the connectivity matrix. In autism, abnormal functional connectivity is one of the most widely reproduced imaging measures and the correlation matrix has been used effectively in many papers. Non-graphical method: The nongraphical method in a combination with the deep learning model gained popularity in recent years. ASD-DiagNet [15] was specially designed for ASD detection and it gave promising results. It is a joint learning method where an autoencoder and single-layer perceptron was combined to improve the features and performance of the classifier. Denoising Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 5 S. Parui et al. Autoencoders were also used in [16] to eliminate the noise of data and get the proper information out of the dataset. Convolution Neural Network is also used to classify the patients with unique element-wise filters for the connectivity network in ABIDE dataset. The model was named CNN-EW [17]. The brain regions were brought into focus for the first time in this paper [18]. The DBN model was introduced to take the brain region into consideration using automated anatomical labeling(AAL), in order to classify ASD patients and TD controls. Graph connectivity network: GCNs have been increasingly used to mimic topological information of brain FCNs as deep learning techniques have advanced [19]. Various methods like ST-GCN (Spatio Temporal Graph Convolutional Network) [20], Eigenpooling GCN [21], and s-GCN(siamese GCN) [22] got immense popularity for fMRI data analysis. Apart from that GroupINN [19] is a method for functional connectivity analysis which extracts graphical features as well as learns node grouping. The clustering results were found satisfactory [19]. BrainGNN [23] is another end-to-end framework for graph connectivity analysis that is capable to do a whole brain fMRI classification by learning ROI clustering. Multi-view graphical method: G. Wen et al. have proposed a method called multi-view graph convolutional network to learn connectivity networks for Autism patients [14]. It is a graph embedding learning from multi-view graph embedding techniques and it can capture the important embedding to improve the performance of the classifier. Another work has done similar types of work and in that paper, the researchers have introduced a sparse multi-view task centralized ensemble learning for diagnosing ASD patients. They have followed multitask learning problems to extract multi-view features for each subject to better notice the Functional connectivity changes [24]. There has been a lot of use of rs-fMRI in ASD research since the early publications, especially since the establishment of data- sharing programs like the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) network [25]. The earliest rs-fMRI investigations [26] in autism seemed to back up the idea of under-connectivity. The origins of functional under-connectivity were investigated using the ABIDE [25] data set in a recent study, to look at both inter-and intra-hemispheric connections. Resting-state fMRI data were used to construct global functional connectivity density, which was separated into ipsilateral and contra-lateral sections for the objectives of the study. 3. Proposed work Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a type of brain imaging technique used to study brain activity. fMRI data is 4 dimensional - 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension. Multiple images of the brain are taken at various time instants and each image shows a 2D slice of the brain. These slices can be thought of as a matrix of 2D pixels. These slices can then be stacked together to form the entire volume of the brain. Thus, the brain volume is expressed in fMRI data by a set of small cubic elements known as voxels (volumetric pixels). Each voxel creates a time series by measuring its operation over time. A time-series analysis of these voxels could yield various parameters and information about the connectivity patterns in the brain which will be useful in the diagnosis of patients with ASD. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a method for scanning the brain using fMRI technology while the subject is resting, as opposed to fMRI where the subject is stimulated by either showing them different objects or being asked to actively think about a stimulus. rs-fMRI is commonly used for studying brain diseases. 3.1. Preprocessing Data from the ABIDE-I dataset was pre-processed using the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (CPAC) [27]. This pre-processed data is made freely and publicly available by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP). The pre-processing procedure included shifting all slices to a common reference point in time, correction to account for the motion of the head in between slices, skull-stripping, and normalizing the global mean intensity. Further, nuisance signal regression was applied. Nuisance signal regression accounts for the variations in signal due to head motion, and physiological processes like heartbeat and respiration. However, for this project, we have excluded global signal regression and bandpass filtering. Also, certain subjects were excluded from the data set as they did not pass the quality assessment. The pipeline also standardized the functional data to MNI152 space (3×3×3 mm resolution. In this project, after pre-processing we have used rs-fMRI data of 780 subjects, 370 of which were suffering from ASD and the remaining 410 were typically developing subjects. 3.2. ROI generation through brain atlas As the number of voxels that can be made from a brain is too large and cannot be efficiently computed, different brain parcellation schemes are available. The brain can be divided into multiple ROIs and each ROI is nothing but a cluster of voxels with brain signal intensity averaged across the time series. The brain atlases used in this project are — AAL with 116 ROIs, HO with 111 ROIs, EZ with 116 ROIs, TT with 97 ROIs, DOS with 161 ROIs, and CC200 with 200 ROIs (Fig. 7). In this project, we have used all the atlases except for the CC400 atlas, as it required a lot more computational power. Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 6 S. Parui et al. Fig. 1. The overview of the system model for ASD detection from fMRI data. 3.3. FC matrix generation For each brain atlas, the correlation between each pair of ROIs was computed from the average time series. First, we estimate the covariance between each pair of ROIs, populate them in a covariance matrix, and then calculate the correlation matrix from the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is estimated using the Ledoit–Wolf estimator. The relationship between correlation and covariance is shown in Eq. (1). 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑥, 𝑦) 𝜎𝑥∗𝜎𝑦 (1) Where 𝜎𝑥and 𝜎𝑦are the standard deviations of 𝑥and 𝑦respectively and 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑥, 𝑦) is the covariance between the two variables 𝑥 and 𝑦. The 𝑁× 𝑁matrix thus obtained is known as the functional connectivity matrix where the number of ROIs (Region of interest) in the brain atlas is 𝑁as shown in Fig. 8. The value of each cell of this correlation matrix represents the amount of correlation between two ROIs which represents the row and column to which the cell belongs. The number of ROIs depends on the type of brain atlases. The matrix size is also the same as the size of ROIs. A highly positive value indicates a strong correlation between two regions of interest, a negative or small positive value indicates an opposite or low correlation between two regions of interest respectively, and a zero correlation is indicative of no correlation between the two ROIs at all. The ROIs can also be visualized as nodes of a graph, with edges connecting one another. The weight of the edge connecting two nodes represents the amount of correlation (i.e., the level of interaction) between them in the functional connectivity matrix. 3.4. Low estimated rank tensor method Unlike earlier efforts, we offer a new assumption in this paper that FCNs have comparable but not identical topologies among subjects. We develop a model to jointly estimate FCNs using Low Estimated Rank Tensor or LERT method. The low-estimated rank tensor (LERT) approximation is recognized as a valuable method for approximating high-dimensional data by its low-rank form, with the premise that the useful information can be represented by a few components based on natural data clustering. The technical specifics of this will be discussed in the following section. The model which has been proposed for this experiment has two steps to follow: Step 1: The functional connectivity matrix was estimated from the pre-processed data. In this paper, we have first calculated the covariance between two ROIs of each ATLAS and then calculated the correlation matrix using the traditional method as they are simple to implement and popular for their promising performance. Also, they do not put any constraint on the main structure which is good for the model as it helps to maintain its properties. Step 2: The second step involves the optimization techniques on the FCN matrix by approximating the tensor. As shown in the figure the 𝑁× 𝑁functional connectivity matrices are bundled together into a 𝑁× 𝑁× 𝑀3-order tensor 𝐴, where the number of subjects is M and the number of ROIs is N.

The low-rank tensor approximation of the 3-order tensor is then computed by solving the below convex equation (2) using polynomial-time algorithms like ADMM [28]. min 𝐿,𝐸 ‖𝐿‖∗+ 𝜆∗‖𝐸‖1 𝑠.𝑡.

The first convolutional net consisted of 32 layers and the next convolutional net consisted of 16 layers, both having kernels of size 3. Both convolutional nets were followed by max-pooling layers of dimensions 2 × 2 for the reduction of dimensions and the number of trainable parameters. The output from the second convolutional network was completely flattened into a 1-D vector and this was then passed through a layer of 128 neurons followed by a single output neuron. Data is flattened when it is made into a 1-dimensional array for input into the following layer. We flatten the convolutional layer output to produce a solitary, lengthy feature vector. ReLu activation was used in every layer except the last output layer where the sigmoid activation function was used for the binary classification of Autism. We have used binary cross-entropy as the metric for loss. A learning rate of 0.001 was used and the model was trained for 100 epochs for each low-rank tensor of the 6 atlases. How quickly the model adapts to the challenge is determined by the learning rate. A 2 – dimensional convolutional neural network was used juxtaposed with a neural network of hidden layers followed by an output node that stores the result of the binary classification. Each functional connectivity matrix formed the input for the CNN. Different atlases required different tuning of hyperparameters. 2 slightly different architectures were used. One for atlases – AAL, CC200, HO, and TT and another for atlases – DOS and EZ. In the model, we have used convolutional layers with ReLu activation and max-pooling layers of size (2 × 2) following that. In both cases, the first 2 convolutional layers have 8 and 16 feature maps with kernel sizes of 3. No padding has been applied to the convolutional layers. In the first case, there is one additional layer of convolution net (32 features, ReLu activation) and a max-pooling layer of size (2 × 2). The output of these conv nets is fed to an MLP (multilayer perceptron) – with 200 neurons and ReLu activation in the 1st hidden layer; 50 neurons and Softmax activation in the 2nd hidden layer and a single neuron with sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification.

Dataset description We have used the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I) dataset in this project. The ABIDE-I dataset is a consortium of rs-fMRI data of 1112 individuals, 539 of which suffer from ASD, and the remaining 573 are typically developing controls, collected Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 10 S. Parui et al. Fig. 6. The architecture of the LERT model for optimization of the connectivity matrix. over 17 international sites. Along with the neuroimages, the dataset also features various demographical information such as age, sex, handedness, etc. The dataset is publicly available. RS-fMRI data of 1112 individuals, 539 of which suffer from ASD and the remaining 573 are typically developing controls, collected over 17 international sites forms the Autism Brain 4 Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE – I) dataset. Along with the neuroimages, the dataset also features various demographical information such as age, sex, handedness, etc. The dataset is publicly available3. RS-fMRI data is 4-dimensional — X, Y, and Z (3 spatial dimensions) and Time (temporal dimension). Multiple images of the brain are taken at various time instants. Each image consists of various slices of the brain and each slice is then pixelated. These slices when stacked together form 3-D pixels which are called voxels (volumetric pixels). A time-series analysis of these voxels could yield various parameters and information about the connectivity patterns in the brain which will be useful in the diagnosis of patients with ASD. 4.2. Experiment 1: Classification strategy planning for different atlas Using Scikit learn a Python library several machine learning algorithm has been implemented on each brain ATLAS. First, we performed LOO Cross-Validation (Leave-one-out) on each atlas using the following classifiers: Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Bayesian Network (BN), Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM), Gaussian Kernel Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), L1-regularized Logistic Regression (L1LR), L2-regularized Logistic Regression (L2LR), Elastic-net-regularized logistic regression (ENLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN)and finally 2 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN). For each atlas, the confusion matrix has been generated and accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative predictive value has been reported to understand which algorithm is performing best and with which brain atlas. For the 2 highest-performer classifiers the stratified 10-fold and 3-fold cross-validations have been applied. 4.2.1. Results In Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4, we have reported the classification performance of the four best-performing ATLAS i.e. AAL(Table no 1), CC200 (Table no 2), DOS (Table no 3), TT(Table no 4) with 11 classifiers. We used LOO cross-validation on our dataset with nine prominent classification algorithms to discover the best techniques for diagnosing ASD vs. TD subjects using rs-fMRI. Several machine-learning methods were used to obtain high LOO cross-validation (Leave one out) accuracy across all brain atlases. A specific version of k-fold cross-validation in which the number of folds equals the number of instances is called leave-one-out cross-validation. Among all of the classifiers, the top two performers are Linear SVM and 2D CNN. It has been noticed that these two classifiers work well with every atlas consistently. Additionally, the AAL, CC200, DOS, and TT atlases are performing well for the classification of Autistic patients and healthy people from their brain connectivity of fMRI signal. Because LOO cross-validation has a significant variation in its estimations of a classifier’s real prediction error, we also used stratified-10-fold and stratified-3-fold cross-validation for LSVM and 2D CNN. Classifier performance remained consistent. For each methodological option, all LSVM and 2D CNN cross-validation accuracies were significant. 4.3. Experiment 2: Training the model with different network architecture The number of epochs for the different atlases for which the model was trained was set as AAL = 25, CC200 = 25, DOS = 23, EZ = 16, HO = 30, TT = 23. The training curves and performance metrics for each atlas have been shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 11 S. Parui et al.

Experiment 3: Low estimated rank tensor method The functional connectivity matrix was estimated from the pre-processed data. In this paper, we have first calculated the covariance between two ROIs of each ATLAS and then calculated the correlation matrix using the traditional method as they are simple to implement and popular for their promising performance. The second step involves the optimization techniques on the FCN matrix by approximating the tensor. As shown in the figure (Fig. 6) the 𝑁× 𝑁functional connectivity matrices are bundled together into a 𝑁× 𝑁× 𝑀3-order tensor 𝐴, where the number of subjects is M and the number of ROIs is N. The low-rank tensor approximation of the 3-order tensor is then computed by solving the below convex equation (2) using polynomial-time algorithms like ADMM. The model was trained for 100 epochs on the LERT of FCNs of each atlas. 4.4.1. Results ROC curve was plotted for the model predictions as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 and the Area under Curve (AUC) was obtained as 0.82. The optimal threshold for binary classification was obtained as the value for which (True Positive Rate–False Positive Rate) was maximized. For an optimal threshold of 0.6039, a maximum accuracy of 76.61 percent was obtained for the AAL atlas which is much higher compared to what was obtained with just the Pearson correlation FCN without a low estimated rank tensor approach, a mere 63.74 percent. This strengthens our motivation to experiment further with low-rank representations (see Table 6). 4.5. Experiment 3: Comparison with the state of the art methods We compared the proposed methodology with various state of art techniques to illustrate the overall performance of functional connectivity diagnosis. To make a comprehensive comparison, the proposed ALERT method was compared with all the traditional methods, the nongraphical method as well as the GCN-based method. In recent studies, some of the work focused on the Multi-view Graphical method which has been proven as a promising one to classify Autistic patients. We have also included more advanced methods like embedded Non-Graphical + Multi-view Graphical Method to understand if our method is working better than that or not. The data set used in the experiments mentioned in the table is the same and all of the methods are trained and tested with the same amount of data. Consistency has been maintained during the comparison to make a fair one. Furthermore, we use the Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 14 S. Parui et al.

Results Compared with other state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed ALERT method gives improved results on ABIDE dataset, as shown in Table 7. Firstly we have noted the performance matrix using traditional methods where the paper worked with PC features and Machine learning classifiers like SVM and RF. Also, the performance of our method outperforms the non-graphical methods which include deep learning methods for classification. To make sure that the ALERT method is the best among all the state-of-the-art techniques we compared its results with the GCN method. And here we get to see significant improvement in inaccuracy. And the best part is while the results were compared to the most promising method of this era is Multiview Graphical method which was developed for ASD detection only the ALERT method also outperformed and noticed an 8.56% improvement in terms of accuracy and 8.25 percent in case of AUC. Some of the papers combined the nongraphical and multiview graphical method to get a promising result in the case of functional connectivity analysis and surprisingly ALERT still was more effective than the ensembled method which indicates that the model is a successful one to indicate whether a patient is autistic or not. 5. Discussion and conclusion In this paper, we have considered the problem of subject variability where any one of the brain atlas cannot be taken into an inspection to find the connectivity of the autistic brain. We have formulated the problem by applying 6 different brain atlas to calculate the connectivity matrix and then applying a majority voting algorithm to find the desired results. Also, a low-estimated rank tensor method has been followed to consider the fact that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies. We started by calculating the Pearson correlation matrix for a functional connectivity network and then stacking the matrices to form a tensor. Then the low estimated rank tensor approach has been followed to redefine those matrices to explore the intrinsic Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 (2023) 108720 15 S. Parui et al. similarities in topology among patients as a bio-marker for a diagnosis. For classification purposes, Convolutional Neural Network has been used. Meanwhile, some discoveries have been made through this experiment. For most atlases, loss on the validation set does not decrease substantially. This might be due to the low representation of the validation set as the size of the data set is not too large. Due to computational complexity, the low estimated rank tensor model could not converge with a smaller error tolerance. The experimental findings showed that our model outperformed other models. In conclusion, the proposed method shows a valid way to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder pretty accurately with artificial intelligence and biosensors. Future work may focus on improving the model accuracy by hyperparameters finer. One can compare different correlation measures such as Spearman’s correlation, Sparse Inverse Covariance, and different atlases. Since the region of interest can be visualized as nodes of a graph, this also opens up the possibility of extracting various graphical/topological features which can help distinguish between the patients and healthy individuals.

Because of its ability to automatically uncover complicated patterns in high-dimensional data, artificial intelligence ( AI ) can be a beneficial tool. Recent improvements in neuroimaging technologies using biosensors have enabled the quantification of functional abnormalities associated with ASD. This work proposes an approach to constructing a functional connectivity network from resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Image ( rs-fMRI ) data. For obtaining a functional connectivity network, the time series component of fMRI data is used, and from it, a correlation matrix is calculated showing the degree of interaction among the brain regions. Several brain atlases have been considered in the experiment. With the majority voting concept based on the results from the atlas, the proposed technique reveals an ASD detection accuracy of 84.79 %. 1.

Parui et al. quick growth of AI software and hardware technologies have been incorporated into many technological domains [ 1 ], including the Internet of Things, computer vision, autonomous driving, natural language processing, and robotics. When researchers used AI in the biomedical area to enhance the results of analysis and therapy, they uncovered an intriguing side to the technology [ 2 ]. As a result, the effectiveness of the healthcare sector as a whole has grown. The new healthcare paradigm must shift from acute, reactive, or even preventative to proactive. Artificial intelligence is being used by an increasing number of medical sensors to diagnose patients more accurately and to monitor and treat them more successfully [ 3 ]. Artificial intelligence ( AI ) and sensor-based devices are widely used in medicine, particularly in the fields of medical image analysis and monitoring systems. Till now detecting neuro-degenerative disease using AI is a very common and emerging field [ 4,5 ]. Because we are not certain of the ground truth or, to put it another way, we lack standardization or have very limited knowledge about the human brain, it continues to be a mystery to us since it behaves differently in various people. As a result of its unpredictability, the human brain is a trendy topic among academics. Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is one of the least understood neurological disorders that has been recently recognized to have major sociological consequences on an affected individual ’ s life. A person having ASD faces several sociological and behavioral challenges that affect his/ her societal interactions and communication abilities. Individuals with ASD are known to exhibit restricted interests and have repetitive behaviors. Even though ASD has been recognized since the early 1960s, the actual etiology remains uncertain. ASD affects one out of every 68 children in the United States [ 6 ]. Early detection is considered the key to developing an appropriate, comprehensive, and advanced treatment plan. A symptom-based diagnosis is common. However, this requires prolonged behavioral examinations under the supervision of a highly skilled multidisciplinary team. Further, owing to alack of definitive etiological causation, symptom-based diagnosis frequently leads to ineffective therapy. The shortcomings of current clinical approaches, as well as alack of understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying ASD, necessitate the development of new biomarkers and computational techniques to help clinicians and neuroscientists better understand how the ASD brain differs from a normal brain. Of late, advances in neuroimaging technologies have made it possible to quantify the functional and structural changes associated with ASD of the brain. According to substantial brain imaging studies, it is now known that ASD has a close link to neural connections in the brain. Individuals suffering from ASD show both under-connectivity and hyper-connectivity between certain regions of the brain. This explains why their lack of empathy and social function maybe compensated with extraordinary performance in other activities. Neuroimaging opens the possibility to analyze these connectivity features in the brain map, which might become the biomarker for differentiation between ASD subjects and typically developing ( TD ) controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has been proven to indicate functional connectivity in ASD brains compared to control brains. Functional connectivity analysis has gained popularity in recent years because it is a simple and cost-effective technique to explore the intrinsic connections between neurons in the brain. Yet the existing approaches lack a wider framework of brain abnormalities detection with fMRI data. It is still unknown how certain brain areas are linked to ASD brain abnormalities. Broadly, functional connectivity measurement is based on the correlation of activation time series in pairs of brain areas. In fact, traditional computational and statistical tools are unable to detect tiny biomarker patterns and categorization. Machine learning algorithms have been explored to identify biomarkers from fMRI datasets. Later on, deep learning approaches like convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) have been applied to solve the problem as a classification problem. However, in the machine learning approach, fora high-dimensional feature space such as the fMRI data, a large amount of training data is often necessary to ensure that enough samples with each combination of values are available. The same is true for deep learning techniques. Although various research on this topic is currently receiving attention, the complexity of this process and estimating the ideal connection remains an open research problem. Despite its numerous advantages, fMRI data can be difficult to deal with due to its complexity, which makes it difficult to remove noise from the data and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Another problem of this research is the lack of availability of a proper dataset for the experiment. Only using data from several sites to train a model may make it difficult for the network to capture complicated patterns in functional connectivity, lowering classification accuracy. The multi-site dataset has an issue with data heterogeneity, whereas the single intra-site dataset is ineffective for training classification algorithms. Research gap and Motivation Brain region identification is a non-trivial task as it varies from one subject to another. Further, fMRI data being Spatiotemporal data suffers from the dimensionality problem. As a consequence, it is another non-trivial task to find connectivities among regions. Even if the need for designing an ideal brain network utilizing the FCN technique is increasing everyday, certain factors make it inconsequential and tough to understand. Therefore, the difficulties have persisted thus far for the following reasons: 1. Subject variability and the fact that every person ’ s brain functions differently. Whole-brain functional connectivity ( FC ) is consistent among participants, but it also contains a subject-specific component. And the method researchers have used to date considered the above-mentioned theory which is partially correct. Because the high-order algorithms have shown that the complex pattern of the brain for all subjects is actually not identical especially when the patients and healthy control both are involved. 2. There is still a lot of opportunity for improvement, and the ‘ ‘ curse of dimensionality ’ ’ is a well-known issue. If we have more features than data, we risk drastically overfitting our model, which would result in poor out-of-sample performance. To minimize over-fitting and hence improve model prediction accuracy and generalization ability, feature reduction is a crucial step before training a machine learning model. And fMRI data is huge in size and to eliminate the previous issues we have maintained versatility in choosing the data set. So it is very obvious that the data is stored in high dimensions and we need to come up with a solution by which we can improve the accuracy by reduction of features keeping the subject variability issue in mind. Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 3 S. Parui et al. 3. For better estimation of the data researchers came up with many solutions like Pearson Correlation coefficient, Sparse Correlation Analysis, Granger Causality, Bayesian Network, Dynamic Causality Modeling, Patels Condition Dependence, etc. Among them, the correlation-based method worked well for ASD datasets previously and proved to be more sensitive than the above-mentioned higher-order complex model. Though the Pearson Correlation method has been depicted as a successful way of making FCN for such disorder detection in some papers. [ 7 ] has addressed the problem of considering identical topology for each and every subject which is not at all convenient where the patients and healthy controls both were involved. The approach described above, therefore, operates under two very distinct assumptions depending on the topological nature of the brain. Therefore, anew approach must be developed that adheres to both assumptions while also upholding the notion that brains have comparable but not identical structures. 4. Another research gap we found is that not much work has been done to understand the proper brain atlas for the selection of nodes and calculation of correlation matrix for any particular disease. As we have discussed earlier subject variability is a big issue to date so it is quite obvious that one brain atlas cannot betaken as a standard to find out the region of interest. People frequently believe that the disparities in our individual personalities and cognitive talents mirror the variances in the ways in which our brains are connected or the nodes are connected. Although individual differences in brain connectivity have long been acknowledged in the neuroscience community, they have not yet been reflected in the resting state study methods during fMRI data collection. Objectives of the work The primary objective is the prediction of ASD from the fMRI data of a subject. In brief, the main objectives of this work areas follows: 1. To extract the signal from specified regions of interest and thus understand the time series signal hidden in the voxel-wise analysis of fMRI data. For this step, we used different brain atlases to find out the most optimized ROIs for this experiment. 2. To compute the atlas-based low-estimated rank tensor of the functional connectivity matrices to explore the inherent similarities in the topology across subjects as a bio-marker to diagnose ASD and to avoid the ‘ ‘ curse of dimensionality ’ ’. 3. To extract the features and classify the healthy controls and patients by a deep learning model and find the best model for each ATLAS to design the final model. Also, we need to test the deep learning model and train it on both the FCNs and their low-rank components and compare the results. Overview of the work In this study, we offer a unique method for estimating FCNs across patients which considers that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies. More specifically, we put this theory into action in three steps. First, we estimate FCNs using conventional techniques. The estimated FCNs are then stacked ( in reality, their associated adjacency matrices ) to form a tensor, and the FCNs are redefined using the low-estimated rank tensor ( LERT ) approach. LERT is a unique algorithm that can optimize the initialized FCN in such away that the tensor can be approximated with a lesser rank. The initially estimated FCNs from the Pearson Correlation technique are staked into a three-order tensor and then recalculated the FCNs through LERT. We aim to employ a low-estimated rank tensor approach on the functional connectivity matrices, exploring the inherent similarities in the topology across subjects as a bio-marker to diagnose ASD. We have tested this algorithm with 6 brain Atlases ( AAL ( Automated Anatomical Labeling ), HO ( Harvard -- Oxford ), EZ ( Eickhoff -- Zilles ), TT ( Talaraich and Tournoux ), DOS ( Dosenbach 160 ), CC200 ( Craddock 200 ) ) which consist of different numbers of ROI, and combined the results to get better accuracy in results in minimum time and complexity. To do so we have used the majority voting algorithm on the brain atlases mentioned earlier after applying alow estimated rank tensor approach and then combined the results coming out from each atlas and predict the results on the test data set. In this study, we offer a unique method for estimating FCNs across patients which considers that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies ( Fig. 1 ). More specifically, we put this theory into action in five steps. 1. First the region of interest has been generated for different brain atlas. The brain atlases used in this project are — AAL with 116 ROIs, HO with 111 ROIs, EZ with 116 ROIs, TT with 97 ROIs, DOS with 161 ROIs, and CC200 with 200 ROIs. 2. For each brain atlas, the correlation between each pair of ROIs was computed from the average time series. First, we estimate the covariance between each pair of ROIs, populate them in a covariance matrix, and then calculate the correlation matrix from the covariance matrix. 3. We develop a model to jointly estimate FCNs using Low Estimated Rank Tensor or LERT method. By using the method we are approximating high-dimensional data by its low-rank form, with the premise that the useful information can be represented by a few components based on natural data clustering. 4. The newly modified FC matrix is then transformed into a tensor and a 2-dimensional CNN has been trained with the tensor. Steps 2–4 have been repeated for each brain atlas mentioned instep 1. 5. Then a majority voting algorithm has been applied to each prediction coming from classifiers for different brain atlases. The output ( whether the subject is a patient ora healthy control ) has been reported. Contribution of the work Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 4 S. Parui et al. 1. As previously stated, there is currently no known treatment for ASD, and diagnosis is particularly challenging because question-and-answer-based diagnosis is not thought to be reliable. Early and accurate detection of ASD can result in early counseling and treatment, which can aid in the patient ’ s recovery. From the patient ’ s fMRI data, a well-designed cognitive framework can provide a diagnosis of the ailment. In this article, we have put up a paradigm based on strategic planning that can more accurately diagnose the condition using the rs-fMRI signal. Through this method, we maybe able to diagnose the illness earlier and begin treatment as soon as feasible. 2. Because rs-fMRI data contains a spatiotemporal signal, many ways to reduce its dimensionality have been tested. As previously stated, the dimension of the fMRI data set is a major issue that can be handled with this single strategy. We reduced the rank of the matrix in this research by estimating the value, and thus the dimension, which allowed us to eliminate the issue of memory consumption as well as time demand. 3. The variety of subjects has also been discussed as a significant concern in this research. For each participant, the topography of the brain is somewhat similar but obviously not identical. Therefore, it is not possible to examine any atlas and obtain reliable results. To eliminate any prejudice, we used a voting mechanism in this article along with topological considerations. Furthermore, because each summary measure captures distinct components of the temporal dimension of the rs-fMRI data, we sought to integrate the various inputs for classification. 4. In this paper, we looked at the concepts of comparable topology and also identical topology. To eliminate subject prejudice, two distinct assumptions were taken into account. Anew technique has been devised that supports the claim that two brains are not the same. And thus we can also successfully distinguish the healthy brain and autistic brain. 5. We employed the greatest number of brain ATLAS to eliminate bias and to account for subject variability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study attempted to employ such measures extensively utilizing deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, because each summary measure captures distinct components of the temporal dimension of the rs-fMRI data, we sought to integrate the various inputs for categorization. 6. We have tested this algorithm with 6 numbers of brain ATLAS which consist of different numbers of ROI and combined the results to get better accuracy in results in minimum time and complexity. To do so we have used the majority voting algorithm on various brain atlas after applying low-rank tensor approximation and then combined the results coming out from each atlas and predict the results on the test dataset. Organization of the paper The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work has been discussed. Section 3 depicts the material and methods used for the experiment which explains the dataset and the steps followed. It also explains the architecture of each model used. Section 4 presents the results observed. Section 5 concludes the work. 2. Related work This section surveys the different techniques related to ASD detection using brain fMRI data. The works are categorized as computational methods, traditional methods, non-graphical methods, graph connectivity network, and multi-view graphical methods and are presented in the following. Computational techniques: ASD has been found to impact global brain networks by disrupting functional connectivity between numerous brain areas. As a result, recent research has focused on multivariate analysis using machine learning ( ML ) techniques to facilitate patient-specific disease quantifiers. Using various imaging modalities, these classifier-based approaches have demonstrated relatively good prediction accuracies [ 8 ]. ML has also been able to assist in the prediction of ASD by adding relationships between brain areas via large-scale structural and/or functional brain connections. The use of neural networks and deep learning methods including autoencoders ( AEs ), long short-term memory ( LSTM ), and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) for detecting ASD has recently become highly popular. Using 10-fold cross-validation, Lidaka et al. [ 9 ] employed the probabilistic neural network and intrinsic connection analysis to achieve an accuracy of classification of 86.9 % between 312 patients with ASD and 328 TD. Brown et al. [ 10 ] used an element-wise layer for CNNs to achieve a classification accuracy of 68.7 % on 1013 subjects. Using the deep learning method, Heinsfeld et al. [ 11 ] studied FC patterns and reached a classification accuracy of 70 %. However, Heinsfeld et al. did not study the changes in categorization between locations. Classification accuracy suffers dramatically when bigger population samples from different places are used. Researchers have used a variety of methods for analyzing brain functional networks since the beginning. The approaches for detecting ASD have yielded good results. Different ideas have been used for different issues with different intentions. We will go over each one individually to get a sense of their work and determine which areas still need to be addressed. Traditional method: Mostly cross-correlation analysis has been used to retrieve the information from data in the case of functional connectivity analysis. Cao and Worsley have established this technique for the first time for functional connectivity MRI ( fcMRI ) data analysis [ 12 ]. The seed-based correlation method [ 13 ] is the simplest method and very usual among all correlation techniques but it has some limitations. Later to overcome the limitations Pearson Correlation method [ 14 ] has been introduced to make the connectivity matrix. In autism, abnormal functional connectivity is one of the most widely reproduced imaging measures and the correlation matrix has been used effectively in many papers. Non-graphical method: The nongraphical method in a combination with the deep learning model gained popularity in recent years. ASD-DiagNet [ 15 ] was specially designed for ASD detection and it gave promising results. It is a joint learning method where an autoencoder and single-layer perceptron was combined to improve the features and performance of the classifier. Denoising Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 5 S. Parui et al. Autoencoders were also used in [ 16 ] to eliminate the noise of data and get the proper information out of the dataset. Convolution Neural Network is also used to classify the patients with unique element-wise filters for the connectivity network in ABIDE dataset. The model was named CNN-EW [ 17 ]. The brain regions were brought into focus for the first time in this paper [ 18 ]. The DBN model was introduced to take the brain region into consideration using automated anatomical labeling ( AAL ), in order to classify ASD patients and TD controls. Graph connectivity network: GCNs have been increasingly used to mimic topological information of brain FCNs as deep learning techniques have advanced [ 19 ]. Various methods like ST-GCN ( SpatioTemporal Graph Convolutional Network ) [ 20 ], Eigenpooling GCN [ 21 ], and s-GCN ( siamese GCN ) [ 22 ] got immense popularity for fMRI data analysis. Apart from that GroupINN [ 19 ] is a method for functional connectivity analysis which extracts graphical features as well as learns node grouping. The clustering results were found satisfactory [ 19 ]. BrainGNN [ 23 ] is another end-to-end framework for graph connectivity analysis that is capable to do a whole brain fMRI classification by learning ROI clustering. Multi-view graphical method: G. Wen et al. have proposed a method called multi-view graph convolutional network to learn connectivity networks for Autism patients [ 14 ]. It is a graph embedding learning from multi-view graph embedding techniques and it can capture the important embedding to improve the performance of the classifier. Another work has done similar types of work and in that paper, the researchers have introduced a sparse multi-view task centralized ensemble learning for diagnosing ASD patients. They have followed multitask learning problems to extract multi-view features for each subject to better notice the Functional connectivity changes [ 24 ]. There has been a lot of use of rs-fMRI in ASD research since the early publications, especially since the establishment of data- sharing programs like the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ( ABIDE ) network [ 25 ]. The earliest rs-fMRI investigations [ 26 ] in autism seemed to backup the idea of under-connectivity. The origins of functional under-connectivity were investigated using the ABIDE [ 25 ] data set in a recent study, to look at both inter-and intra-hemispheric connections. Resting-state fMRI data were used to construct global functional connectivity density, which was separated into ipsilateral and contra-lateral sections for the objectives of the study. 3. Proposed work Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) is a type of brain imaging technique used to study brain activity. fMRI data is 4 dimensional - 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension. Multiple images of the brain are taken at various time instants and each image shows a 2D slice of the brain. These slices can bethought of as a matrix of 2D pixels. These slices can then be stacked together to form the entire volume of the brain. Thus, the brain volume is expressed in fMRI data by a set of small cubic elements known as voxels ( volumetric pixels ). Each voxel creates a time series by measuring its operation overtime. A time-series analysis of these voxels could yield various parameters and information about the connectivity patterns in the brain which will be useful in the diagnosis of patients with ASD. Resting-state fMRI ( rs-fMRI ) is a method for scanning the brain using fMRI technology while the subject is resting, as opposed to fMRI where the subject is stimulated by either showing them different objects or being asked to actively think about a stimulus. rs-fMRI is commonly used for studying brain diseases. 3.1. Preprocessing Data from the ABIDE-I dataset was pre-processed using the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes ( CPAC ) [ 27 ]. This pre-processed data is made freely and publicly available by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project ( PCP ). The pre-processing procedure included shifting all slices to a common reference point in time, correction to account for the motion of the head in between slices, skull-stripping, and normalizing the global mean intensity. Further, nuisance signal regression was applied. Nuisance signal regression accounts for the variations in signal due to head motion, and physiological processes like heartbeat and respiration. However, for this project, we have excluded global signal regression and bandpass filtering. Also, certain subjects were excluded from the data set as they did not pass the quality assessment. The pipeline also standardized the functional data to MNI152 space ( 3×3×3 mm resolution. In this project, after pre-processing we have used rs-fMRI data of 780 subjects, 370 of which were suffering from ASD and the remaining 410 were typically developing subjects. 3.2. ROI generation through brain atlas As the number of voxels that can be made from a brain is too large and cannot be efficiently computed, different brain parcellation schemes are available. The brain can be divided into multiple ROIs and each ROI is nothing but a cluster of voxels with brain signal intensity averaged across the time series. The brain atlases used in this project are — AAL with 116 ROIs, HO with 111 ROIs, EZ with 116 ROIs, TT with 97 ROIs, DOS with 161 ROIs, and CC200 with 200 ROIs ( Fig. 7 ). In this project, we have used all the atlases except for the CC400 atlas, as it required a lot more computational power. Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 6 S. Parui et al. Fig. 1. The overview of the system model for ASD detection from fMRI data. 3.3. FC matrix generation For each brain atlas, the correlation between each pair of ROIs was computed from the average time series. First, we estimate the covariance between each pair of ROIs, populate them in a covariance matrix, and then calculate the correlation matrix from the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is estimated using the Ledoit–Wolf estimator. The relationship between correlation and covariance is shown in Eq. ( 1 ). 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝐶𝑜𝑣 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) 𝜎𝑥∗𝜎𝑦 ( 1 ) Where 𝜎𝑥and 𝜎𝑦are the standard deviations of 𝑥and 𝑦respectively and 𝐶𝑜𝑣 ( 𝑥, 𝑦 ) is the covariance between the two variables 𝑥 and 𝑦. The 𝑁× 𝑁matrix thus obtained is known as the functional connectivity matrix where the number of ROIs ( Region of interest ) in the brain atlas is 𝑁as shown in Fig. 8. The value of each cell of this correlation matrix represents the amount of correlation between two ROIs which represents the row and column to which the cell belongs. The number of ROIs depends on the type of brain atlases. The matrix size is also the same as the size of ROIs. A highly positive value indicates a strong correlation between two regions of interest, a negative or small positive value indicates an opposite or low correlation between two regions of interest respectively, and a zero correlation is indicative of no correlation between the two ROIs at all. The ROIs can also be visualized as nodes of a graph, with edges connecting one another. The weight of the edge connecting two nodes represents the amount of correlation ( i. e., the level of interaction ) between them in the functional connectivity matrix. 3.4. Low estimated rank tensor method Unlike earlier efforts, we offer anew assumption in this paper that FCNs have comparable but not identical topologies among subjects. We develop a model to jointly estimate FCNs using Low Estimated Rank Tensor or LERT method. The low-estimated rank tensor ( LERT ) approximation is recognized as a valuable method for approximating high-dimensional data by its low-rank form, with the premise that the useful information can be represented by a few components based on natural data clustering. The technical specifics of this will be discussed in the following section. The model which has been proposed for this experiment has two steps to follow: Step 1: The functional connectivity matrix was estimated from the pre-processed data. In this paper, we have first calculated the covariance between two ROIs of each ATLAS and then calculated the correlation matrix using the traditional method as they are simple to implement and popular for their promising performance. Also, they do not put any constraint on the main structure which is good for the model as it helps to maintain its properties. Step 2: The second step involves the optimization techniques on the FCN matrix by approximating the tensor. As shown in the figure the 𝑁× 𝑁functional connectivity matrices are bundled together into a 𝑁× 𝑁× 𝑀3-order tensor 𝐴, where the number of subjects isM and the number of ROIs is N.

The first convolutional net consisted of 32 layers and the next convolutional net consisted of 16 layers, both having kernels of size 3. Both convolutional nets were followed by max-pooling layers of dimensions 2 × 2 for the reduction of dimensions and the number of trainable parameters. The output from the second convolutional network was completely flattened into a 1-D vector and this was then passed through a layer of 128 neurons followed by a single output neuron. Data is flattened when it is made into a 1-dimensional array for input into the following layer. We flatten the convolutional layer output to produce a solitary, lengthy feature vector. ReLu activation was used in every layer except the last output layer where the sigmoid activation function was used for the binary classification of Autism. We have used binary cross-entropy as the metric for loss. A learning rate of 0.001 was used and the model was trained for 100 epochs for each low-rank tensor of the 6 atlases. How quickly the model adapts to the challenge is determined by the learning rate. A 2 – dimensional convolutional neural network was used juxtaposed with a neural network of hidden layers followed by an output node that stores the result of the binary classification. Each functional connectivity matrix formed the input for the CNN. Different atlases required different tuning of hyperparameters. 2 slightly different architectures were used. One for atlases – AAL, CC200, HO, and TT and another for atlases – DOS and EZ. In the model, we have used convolutional layers with ReLu activation and max-pooling layers of size ( 2 × 2 ) following that. In both cases, the first 2 convolutional layers have 8 and 16 feature maps with kernel sizes of 3. No padding has been applied to the convolutional layers. In the first case, there is one additional layer of convolution net ( 32 features, ReLu activation ) and a max-pooling layer of size ( 2 × 2 ). The output of these conv nets is fed to an MLP ( multilayer perceptron ) – with 200 neurons and ReLu activation in the 1st hidden layer; 50 neurons and Softmax activation in the 2nd hidden layer and a single neuron with sigmoid activation in the output layer for binary classification.

Dataset description We have used the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ( ABIDE-I ) dataset in this project. The ABIDE-I dataset is a consortium of rs-fMRI data of 1112 individuals, 539 of which suffer from ASD, and the remaining 573 are typically developing controls, collected Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 10 S.

Along with the neuroimages, the dataset also features various demographical information such as age, sex, handedness, etc. The dataset is publicly available. RS-fMRI data of 1112 individuals, 539 of which suffer from ASD and the remaining 573 are typically developing controls, collected over 17 international sites forms the Autism Brain 4 Imaging Data Exchange ( ABIDE – I ) dataset. Along with the neuroimages, the dataset also features various demographical information such as age, sex, handedness, etc. The dataset is publicly available3. RS-fMRI data is 4-dimensional — X, Y, and Z ( 3 spatial dimensions ) and Time ( temporal dimension ). Multiple images of the brain are taken at various time instants. Each image consists of various slices of the brain and each slice is then pixelated. These slices when stacked together form 3-D pixels which are called voxels ( volumetric pixels ). A time-series analysis of these voxels could yield various parameters and information about the connectivity patterns in the brain which will be useful in the diagnosis of patients with ASD. 4.2. Experiment 1: Classification strategy planning for different atlas Using Scikit learn a Python library several machine learning algorithm has been implemented on each brain ATLAS. First, we performed LOO Cross-Validation ( Leave-one-out ) on each atlas using the following classifiers: Random Forest ( RF ), K-nearest neighbor ( KNN ), Bayesian Network ( BN ), Linear Support Vector Machine ( Linear SVM ), Gaussian Kernel Support Vector Machine ( RBF-SVM ), Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ), L1-regularized Logistic Regression ( L1LR ), L2-regularized Logistic Regression ( L2LR ), Elastic-net-regularized logistic regression ( ENLR ), Artificial Neural Network ( ANN ) and finally 2 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network ( 2D-CNN ). For each atlas, the confusion matrix has been generated and accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative predictive value has been reported to understand which algorithm is performing best and with which brain atlas. For the 2 highest-performer classifiers the stratified 10-fold and 3-fold cross-validations have been applied. 4.2.1. Results In Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4, we have reported the classification performance of the four best-performing ATLAS i. e. AAL ( Table no 1 ), CC200 ( Table no 2 ), DOS ( Table no 3 ), TT ( Table no 4 ) with 11 classifiers. We used LOO cross-validation on our dataset with nine prominent classification algorithms to discover the best techniques for diagnosing ASD vs. TD subjects using rs-fMRI. Several machine-learning methods were used to obtain high LOO cross-validation ( Leave one out ) accuracy across all brain atlases. A specific version of k-fold cross-validation in which the number of folds equals the number of instances is called leave-one-out cross-validation. Among all of the classifiers, the top two performers are Linear SVM and 2D CNN. It has been noticed that these two classifiers work well with every atlas consistently. Additionally, the AAL, CC200, DOS, and TT atlases are performing well for the classification of Autistic patients and healthy people from their brain connectivity of fMRI signal. Because LOO cross-validation has a significant variation in its estimations of a classifier ’ s real prediction error, we also used stratified-10-fold and stratified-3-fold cross-validation for LSVM and 2D CNN. Classifier performance remained consistent. For each methodological option, all LSVM and 2D CNN cross-validation accuracies were significant. 4.3. Experiment 2: Training the model with different network architecture The number of epochs for the different atlases for which the model was trained was set as AAL = 25, CC200 = 25, DOS = 23, EZ = 16, HO = 30, TT = 23. The training curves and performance metrics for each atlas have been shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 11 S. Parui et al.

Experiment 3: Low estimated rank tensor method The functional connectivity matrix was estimated from the pre-processed data. In this paper, we have first calculated the covariance between two ROIs of each ATLAS and then calculated the correlation matrix using the traditional method as they are simple to implement and popular for their promising performance. The second step involves the optimization techniques on the FCN matrix by approximating the tensor. As shown in the figure ( Fig. 6 ) the 𝑁× 𝑁functional connectivity matrices are bundled together into a 𝑁× 𝑁× 𝑀3-order tensor 𝐴, where the number of subjects isM and the number of ROIs is N. The low-rank tensor approximation of the 3-order tensor is then computed by solving the below convex equation ( 2 ) using polynomial-time algorithms like ADMM. The model was trained for 100 epochs on the LERT of FCNs of each atlas. 4.4.1. Results ROC curve was plotted for the model predictions as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 and the Area under Curve ( AUC ) was obtained as 0.82. The optimal threshold for binary classification was obtained as the value for which ( True Positive Rate–False Positive Rate ) was maximized. For an optimal threshold of 0.6039, a maximum accuracy of 76.61 percent was obtained for the AAL atlas which is much higher compared to what was obtained with just the Pearson correlation FCN without alow estimated rank tensor approach, a mere 63.74 percent. This strengthens our motivation to experiment further with low-rank representations ( see Table 6 ). 4.5. Experiment 3: Comparison with the state of the art methods We compared the proposed methodology with various state of art techniques to illustrate the overall performance of functional connectivity diagnosis. To make a comprehensive comparison, the proposed ALERT method was compared with all the traditional methods, the nongraphical method as well as the GCN-based method. In recent studies, some of the work focused on the Multi-view Graphical method which has been proven as a promising one to classify Autistic patients. We have also included more advanced methods like embedded Non-Graphical + Multi-view Graphical Method to understand if our method is working better than that or not. The data set used in the experiments mentioned in the table is the same and all of the methods are trained and tested with the same amount of data. Consistency has been maintained during the comparison to make a fair one. Furthermore, we use the Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 14 S. Parui et al.

Results Compared with other state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed ALERT method gives improved results on ABIDE dataset, as shown in Table 7. Firstly we have noted the performance matrix using traditional methods where the paper worked with PC features and Machine learning classifiers like SVM and RF. Also, the performance of our method outperforms the non-graphical methods which include deep learning methods for classification. To make sure that the ALERT method is the best among all the state-of-the-art techniques we compared its results with the GCN method. And here we get to see significant improvement in inaccuracy. And the best part is while the results were compared to the most promising method of this era is Multiview Graphical method which was developed for ASD detection only the ALERT method also outperformed and noticed an 8.56 % improvement in terms of accuracy and 8.25 percent incase of AUC. Some of the papers combined the nongraphical and multiview graphical method to get a promising result in the case of functional connectivity analysis and surprisingly ALERT still was more effective than the ensembled method which indicates that the model is a successful one to indicate whether a patient is autistic or not. 5. Discussion and conclusion In this paper, we have considered the problem of subject variability where anyone of the brain atlas cannot betaken into an inspection to find the connectivity of the autistic brain. We have formulated the problem by applying 6 different brain atlas to calculate the connectivity matrix and then applying a majority voting algorithm to find the desired results. Also, a low-estimated rank tensor method has been followed to consider the fact that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies. We started by calculating the Pearson correlation matrix fora functional connectivity network and then stacking the matrices to form a tensor. Then the low estimated rank tensor approach has been followed to redefine those matrices to explore the intrinsic Computers and Electrical Engineering 108 ( 2023 ) 108720 15 S. Parui et al. similarities in topology among patients as a bio-marker fora diagnosis. For classification purposes, Convolutional Neural Network has been used. Meanwhile, some discoveries have been made through this experiment. For most atlases, loss on the validation set does not decrease substantially. This might be due to the low representation of the validation set as the size of the data set is not too large. Due to computational complexity, the low estimated rank tensor model could not converge with a smaller error tolerance. The experimental findings showed that our model outperformed other models. In conclusion, the proposed method shows a valid way to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder pretty accurately with artificial intelligence and biosensors. Future work may focus on improving the model accuracy by hyperparameters finer. One can compare different correlation measures such as Spearman ’ s correlation, Sparse Inverse Covariance, and different atlases. Since the region of interest can be visualized as nodes of a graph, this also opens up the possibility of extracting various graphical/topological features which can help distinguish between the patients and healthy individuals.

            "Artificial intelligence is being used by an increasing number of medical sensors to diagnose patients more accurately. As a result, the effectiveness of the healthcare sector as a whole has grown. The new healthcare paradigm must shift from acute, reactive, or even preventative to proactive.\n",
            "Artificial intelligence ( AI ) and sensor-based devices are widely used in medicine, particularly in the fields of medical image analysis and monitoring systems. Till now detecting neuro-degenerative disease using AI is a very common and emerging field. Autism spectrum disorder is one of the least understood neurological disorders.\n",
            " ASD affects one out of every 68 children in the United States. Individuals with ASD are known to exhibit restricted interests and have repetitive behaviors. Early detection is considered the key to developing an appropriate, comprehensive, and advanced treatment plan. A symptom-based diagnosis is common. However, this requires prolonged behavioral examinations under the supervision of a highly skilled multidisciplinary team.\n",
            "The shortcomings of current clinical approaches, as well as alack of understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying ASD, necessitate the development of new biomarkers and computational techniques. Of late, advances in neuroimaging technologies have made it possible to quantify the functional and structural changes associated with ASD of the brain.\n",
            "Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has been proven to indicate functional connectivity in ASD brains compared to control brains. Individuals suffering from ASD show both under-connectivity and hyper-Connectivity between certain regions of the brain. This explains why their lack of empathy and social function maybe compensated with extraordinary performance in other activities.\n",
            "It is still unknown how certain brain areas are linked to ASD brain abnormalities. Traditional computational and statistical tools are unable to detect tiny biomarker patterns and categorization. Machine learning algorithms have been explored to identify biomarkers from fMRI datasets. Later on, deep learning approaches like convolutional neural networks have been applied to solve the problem as a classification problem.\n",
            "FMRI data can be difficult to deal with due to its complexity, which makes it difficult to remove noise from the data. Another problem of this research is the lack of availability of a proper dataset for the experiment. Only using data from several sites to train a model may make it difficult for the netw\n",

Multi-site dataset has an issue with data heterogeneity, whereas the single intra- site dataset is ineffective for training classification algorithms. o train a model may make it difficult for the network to capture complicated patterns in functional connectivity, lowering classification accuracy.\n",
            "Whole-brain functional connectivity ( FC ) is consistent among participants, but it also contains a subject-specific component. There is still a lot of opportunity for improvement, and the ‘ ‘ curse of dimensionality ’ ’ is a well-known issue.\n",
            " feature reduction is a crucial step before training a machine learning model. And fMRI data is huge in size and to eliminate the previous issues we have maintained versatility in choosing the data set. For better estimation of the data researchers came up with many solutions like Pearson Correl.\n",
            "The correlation-based method worked well for ASD datasets previously and proved to be more sensitive than the above-mentioned higher-order complex model. The approach described above, therefore, operates under two very distinct assumptions depending on the topological natu. The Pearson Correlation method has been depicted as a successful way of making FCN for such disorder detection in some papers.\n",
            "Not much work has been done to understand the proper brain atlas for the selection of nodes and calculation of correlation matrix for any particular disease. New approach must be developed that adheres to both assumptions while also upholding the notion that brains have comparable but not identical structures.\n",
            "The primary objective is the prediction of ASD from the fMRI data of a subject. The main objectives of this work areas follows: 1. To extract the signal from specified regions of interest and thus understand the time series signal. 2. To compute the atlas-based low-estimated rank tensor of the functional connectivity matrices.\n",
            "We offer a unique method for estimating FCNs across patients which considers that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies. We put this theory into action in three steps. First, we estimate FCNs using conventional techniques. Second, we extract the features and classify the healthy controls and patients by a deep learning model. Third, we find the best model for each ATLAS to design\n",
            "We aim to employ a low-estimated rank tensor approach on the functional connectivity matrices. We explore the inherent similarities in the topology across subjects as a bio-marker to diagnose ASD. We have tested this algorithm with 6 brain Atlases ( AAL ( Automated Anatomical Labeling).\n",
            "In this study, we offer a unique method for estimating FCNs across patients which considers that the functional brain follows comparable but not identical topologies. We have used the majority voting algorithm on the brain atlases mentioned earlier after applying alow estimated rank tensor approach. More specifically, we put this theory into action in five steps.\n",
            "The brain atlases used are AAL, HO, EZ, TT, DOS and CC200. For each brain atlas, the correlation between each pair of ROIs was computed from the average time series. We develop a model to jointly estimate FCNs using Low Estimated Rank Tensor.\n",

From the patient ’ s fMRI data, a well-designed cognitive framework can provide a diagnosis of the ailment. Through this method, we maybe able to diagnose the illness earlier and begin treatment as soon as feasible.\n",
            "We reduced the rank of the matrix in this research by estimating the value, and thus the dimension, which allowed us to eliminate the issue of memory consumption as well as time demand. For each participant, the topography of the brain is somewhat similar but obviously not identical. We used a voting mechanism in this article along with topological considerations.\n",
            "Anew technique has been devised that supports the claim that two brains are not the same. And thus we can also successfully distinguish the healthy brain and autistic brain. To eliminate subject prejudice, two distinct assumptions were taken into account. We employed the greatest number of brain ATLAS to eliminate bias and to account for subject variability.\n",
            "We have used the majority voting algorithm on various brain atlas after applying low-rank tensor approximation. We have tested this algorithm with 6 numbers of brain ATLAS which consist of different numbers of ROI and combined the results to get better accuracy in results in minimum time and complexity.\n",
            "This section surveys the different techniques related to ASD detection using brain fMRI data. The works are categorized as computational methods, traditional methods, non-graphical methods, graph connectivity network, and multi-view graphical methods. Section 4 presents the results observed. each model used.\n",
            "ML has also been able to assist in the prediction of ASD by adding relationships between brain areas via large-scale structural and/or functional brain connections. The use of neural networks and deep learning methods including autoencoders ( AEs ), long short-term memory ( LSTM ) for detecting ASD has recently become highly popular.\n",
            "The approaches for detecting ASD have yielded good results. Different ideas have been used for different issues with different intentions. We will go over each one individually to get a sense of their work and determine which areas still need to be addressed. Traditional method: Mostly cross-correlation analysis has been used.\n",
            "Cao and Worsley have established this technique for the first time for functional connectivity MRI ( fcMRI ) data analysis. The seed-based correlation method is the simplest method and very usual among all correlation techniques. In autism, abnormal functional connectivity is one of the most widely reproduced imaging measures.\n",
            "Autoencoders were also used in [ 16 ] to eliminate the noise of data and get the proper information out of the dataset. Convolution Neural Network is also used to classify the patients with unique element-wise filters for the connectivity network in ABIDE dataset. The model was named CNN-EW.\n",
            " Graph connectivity network: GCNs have been increasingly used to mimic topological information of brain FCNs as deep learning techniques have advanced. Various methods like ST-GCN ( SpatioTemporal Graph Convolutional Network ) [ 20 ] and Eigenpooling GCN [ 21 ] got immense popularity for fMRI data analysis.\n",
            "G. Wen et al. have proposed a method called multi-view graph convolutional network to learn connectivity networks for Autism patients. BrainGNN is another end-to-end framework for graph connectivity analysis that is capable to do a whole brain fMRI classification by learning ROI clustering.\n",

Resting-state fMRI data were used to construct global functional connectivity density. Proposed work Functional Magnetic Re. features for each subject to better notice the Functional connectivity changes.\n",

Multiple images of the brain are taken at various time instants and each image shows a 2D slice of thebrain.\n",

            "We have used rs-fMRI data of 780 subjects, 370 of which were suffering from ASD and the remaining 410 were typically developing subjects. Nuisance signal regression accounts for the variations in signal due to head motion, and physiological processes like heartbeat and respiration. We have excluded global signal regression and bandpass filtering.\n",
            "The number of voxels that can be made from a brain is too large and cannot be efficiently computed. Different brain parcellation schemes are available. The brain can be divided into multiple ROIs and each ROI is nothing but a cluster of v Voxels.\n",
            "For each brain atlas, the correlation between each pair of ROIs was computed from the average time series. The relationship between correlation and covariance is shown in Eq. ( 1 ). The  functional connectivity matrix is known as the functional connectivity matrix.\n",
            "The number of ROIs depends on the type of brain atlases. A highly positive value indicates a strong correlation between two regions of interest. The ROIs can also be visualized as nodes of a graph, with edges connecting one another.\n",
            "We develop a model to jointly estimate FCNs using Low Estimated Rank Tensor or LERT method. The weight of the edge connecting two nodes represents the amount of correlation ( i. e., the level of interaction ) between them in the functional connectivity matrix. The technical specifics of this will be discussed in the following sections.\n",
            "The model which has been proposed for this experiment has two steps to follow: Step 1: The functional connectivity matrix was estimated from the pre-processed data. Step 2: The second step involves the optimization techniques on the FCN matrix by approximating the tensor.\n",
